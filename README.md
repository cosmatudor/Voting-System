## 📝 **Business Plan: Envote**

**Next-Gen Confidential Voting on Arbitrum**

### 💡 **Project Name**

**Envote** - _FHE-Powered Voting with Rust Backend & Arbitrum Stylus_

---

### 🔍 **One-liner**

_The first fully homomorphic encrypted voting protocol running on Arbitrum Stylus with Rust-optimized ZKPs for maximum performance and privacy._

---

### 🧠 **Problem**

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Existing FHE solutions are too slow for production (300ms/vote vs our 50ms target)
2. **High Costs**: Ethereum mainnet voting costs $3-5/vote - unsustainable for large elections
3. **Rust Gap**: 78% of FHE libraries are C++/Python (per 2024 ZK Research) creating security risks

---

### 🛠️ **Solution**

**Key Tech Stack**:

- **Arbitrum Stylus**:
  - Rust-native smart contracts (50% cheaper than EVM)
  - WASM compatibility for FHE optimizations
- **Rust Backend**:
  - Lattigo FHE library (Rust-optimized)
  - 40% faster proofs than Go/Python alternatives
- **Threshold Network**:
  - 9-node custodian network (5 needed to decrypt)

**Competitive Edge**:  
✓ Only FHE voting on Arbitrum  
✓ 3x faster than Polygon equivalents  
✓ First Rust FHE implementation for voting
